The data contains four variables.

The first variable is called Subject and contains one
numeric value representing the subject number.
This value is a number from 1 to 30 because there are data from 30 subjects
_____________________________________________________________

The second variable is called activity and names the six
activities the subject was measured by: "walking","walking_upstairs","walking_downstairs","sitting","standing","laying"
_____________________________________________________________

The third variable is called measure an contains the various measurements (features) assessed. For a more precis description see the above information:

Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ an
tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were
 filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise.
 Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals 
 (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals 
(tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using 
the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, 
fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

The fourth variable is called value and contains the mean value for each subject x activity x measure combination. The data assesment and the units of the variable are described in the explanation of the third variable above.
